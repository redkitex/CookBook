# CookBook
A recipe database app.

This project is a digital cookbook, where recipes can be **digitised**, **stored**, **filtered** by ingredients used, the type of recipe and its duration, and **sorted** by various attributes.

Recipes are stored in a MS Access database using `ucanaccess` and displayed in a table using the `net.proteanit.sql.DbUtils` library.

## **Usage**

To use the CookBook as a developer you will need:

1. Apache Netbeans
2. MS Access
3. Java
